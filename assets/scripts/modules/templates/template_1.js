				<h3>First this!</h3>
				<p class='relative'><strong class='topic'>Transparent & Secure:</strong> The principle for all the following steps.</p>
				<h3>Then the steps to be taken!</h3>
				<ol class='relative' role='list'>
					<li class='relative'><strong class='topic'>Community:</strong> Building a strong community that works together, with as goal to achieve the following steps and get better from it.</li>
					<li class='relative'><strong class='topic'>Network:</strong> Building the network and raising funds to realize <strong>The SpaceMall</strong>.</li>
					<li class='relative'><strong class='topic'>2D Version:</strong> Once the funds are available, a 2D version will be built first.</li>
					<li class='relative'><strong class='topic'>3D Version:</strong> Continue and <strong>The Space Mall</strong> will be created as intended.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Global</h3>
				<p><strong>The SpaceMall</strong> will run worldwide.</p>
				<h3>Top notch developers!</h3>
				<p>For this project they have top notch developers in house, people who have earned their credits already!</p>
				<h3>Securing a store!</h3>
				<p>As it is a new consept with very attractive conditions, the expectations are high!</p>
				<p>Therefore, buying a license and securing a space now might be a good idea!</p>
				<h3>Buying a License.</h3>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>The lowest license to secure a shop costs 650USD a year.</p>
				<h3>Loyalty Points (LP)</h3>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>In return you get <span class='quoted-double'>Loyalty Points</span> that:</p>
				<ul class='relative' role='list'>
					<li class='list-disc relative'><strong class='topic'>Value:</strong> this represents a value of 110% of TSM tokens.</li>
					<li class='list-disc relative'><strong class='topic'>Exchange:</strong> once the TSM Token reaches a predefined value, the token will be listed on various exchanges and that is the moment that you can exchange your <span class='quoted-double'>Loyalty Points</span> for <span class='quoted-double '>TSM Tokens</span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Possibility.</h3>
				<p>There are more licenses to choose from, but I will use the Senior(650USD) as an example.</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>For the Senior, you will get 650LP and that represents a value of 3250 *TSM Tokens.</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>At the moment it will be listed on the exchanges it will have a value of about 0.23 USD cents</p>
				<p class='asterix relative'> The TSM Token has a limited supply and demand will grow, so the market value will grow accordingly!</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>3250 * 0.23 cents is 747.5 USD</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>Let's say the market value has grown to 2USD</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>That is 2USD / 0.23 cents = ca 8.7</p>
				<p class='ltr-arrow relative'>The result of the 650USD investment = 8.7 * 747.5 USD = 6.503,25 USD.</p>
				<p>That is about 10 years shop rent!</p>
				<p>Note, this is just an example and no warranty!</p>
				<h3>More benefits.</h3>
				<p>There are some more benefits and you will be informed about, after you subscribe!</p>
